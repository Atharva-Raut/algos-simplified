# Algorithms Simplified

## By the Web & Coding Club IIT Bombay

Greetings from the Web & Coding Club!

WnCC proudly presents __Algorithms Simplified__. This is a series where we **do not require you to code**. You can just watch a 15 min video to learn something cool, thatâ€™s it!

Here's the list of topics covered till now:
- [Sorting Algorithms](./Sorting_Algorithm/README.md)
- [Mini-Max Algorithm](./MiniMax-Algorithm/README.md)
- [Shotest Path Algorithms (Basic)](./Shortest_Path_Algorithms_Basic/README.md)
- [Heuristic Algorithms](./Heuristic-Algorithms/README.md)
- [Fast Multiplication using Divide and Conquer](./Divide_And_Conquer_Multiplication/README.md)
- [Encryption Algorithms](./Encryption_Algorithms/README.md)
- [Probabilistic_Algorithms](./Probabilistic_Algorithm/README.md)
- [Wumpus World Agent](https://github.com/wncc/algos-simplified/tree/master/Wumpus%20World)
- [Object Detection](https://github.com/wncc/algos-simplified/tree/master/Object%20Detection%20Algorithms)

Every Friday, short videos trivially explaining some mind-blowing yet intuitive algorithms will be shared, along with **optional**  tasks for those who want to code and implement those algorithms in a *Dive Deep* section as well.

Join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/Go8oWRUqXsSufvCA75qMUQ) for discussing your doubts.
